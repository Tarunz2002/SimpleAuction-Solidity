# Smart Contract Details:
The smart contract consists of the following main components:

Library - SafeMath: This library contains functions for safe mathematical operations to prevent overflows and underflows.

Contract - Auction: This is the main auction contract that handles the bidding process. It includes the following functions:

placeBid(address auctionAddress, uint bidAmount): Allows participants to place bids for the specified auction address.

viewBids(address auctionAddress): Allows anyone to view the bids placed for the specified auction address.

acceptBid(address auctionAddress, uint bidIndex): Allows the auction owner to accept a bid by specifying the bid index from the list of bids.

endAuction(address auctionAddress): Allows the auction owner to end the auction and determine the winning bid.

# Events:
The contract emits the following events:

BidPlaced(address auctionAddress, uint bidAmount, address bidder): Triggered when a bid is placed by a bidder.
BidAccepted(address auctionAddress, uint bidAmount, address bidder): Triggered when a bid is accepted by the auction owner.
AuctionEnded(address auctionAddress): Triggered when the auction is ended by the auction owner.

# Usage:

Deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
Participants can place bids using the placeBid function by providing the auction address and the bid amount.
The auction owner can accept a bid using the acceptBid function by providing the auction address and the bid index from the list of bids.
The auction owner can end the auction using the endAuction function, which will mark the auction as inactive and determine the winning bid.
